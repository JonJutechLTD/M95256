# Arduino library for ST Microelectronics M95256 SPI EEPROM

**!!! THIS LIBRARY WAS FORKED FROM https://github.com/stefandz/M95M01 AND NOT TESTED THEREFORE COMES WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY !!!**

This is a simple library for the [ST Microelectronics M95256 SPI EEPROM](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/mmc/FM76/CL1276/SC112/PF167935). It is probably quite easy to extend this library for other EEPROMs in the M95XXX series - please feel free to fork and improve!

Not all functions are covered in this library - just read and write (for bytes and byte arrays). Again, if you want to implement status register manipulation functions, please do.
